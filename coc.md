# Code of Conduct

The [bitcoin-crosschain community](https://matrix.to/#/!XpOFaFuEgvQitNFILo:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) aims to be a welcoming space for Bitcoiners to discuss crosschain protocols and applications. We are excited to see BTC being used on many chains and want to push this technology forward in a way that centers BTC as the reserve asset and first-class money of the crosschain economy.

We have two rules:
- Be cool
- Stay on topic

In case these rules need elaboration:

**Be cool**  
We want the community to be fun. Disagreements are fine, but if you must disagree, keep it cool, professional, friendly, collegial - not aggressive, rude, or disrespectful. If you feel a conversation starting to get heated, that's a good sign to either try and de-escalate, or close the chat and take a walk.

**Stay on topic**  
The topic of this community is bitcoin crosschain protocols and applications. We specifically focus on protocols and apps that enable bitcoin (BTC) to be used on bitcoin sidechains. A bitcoin sidechain is a blockchain that uses bitcoin (via a "pegged" version of BTC) as the "native" or "first-class" money for making transactions and paying mining fees.

While we respect the innovation happening in other cryptocurrency communities to enable crosschain protocols, there are other communities online that focus on these other cryptocurrencies. We are happy to learn about innovation happening elsewhere but remain mindful to keep the discussion centered around how we can bring these technologies into the bitcoin crosschain ecosystem.

It should go without saying, but please keep our community spaces free of spam, altcoin promotion, price talk, personal disputes, flame wars, trolling, and other off-topic or disruptive behavior.

## Enforcement

The admins of bitcoin-crosschain community spaces reserve the right to delete any messages and ban any accounts without notice. However, the general protocol we will follow for minor offenses will be:

1. Take a screenshot of the offending post
2. Immediately delete the post if it is obvious spam or otherwise poses an immediate threat to the community e.g. illegal material
3. Private message the offender asking them to delete or edit their message, with specific details about why the post goes against the rules
4. Ban repeat offenders (there may or may not be a second chance depending on the severity of the offense)

If you see any behavior that you think violates this code of conduct, please report to @lightcoin:matrix.org on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/clients) via private message.
